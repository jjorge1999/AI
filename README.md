A comprehensive Inventory Management and Point of Sale (POS) system built with a modern web stack. This application integrates inventory tracking, sales processing, real-time chat, and activity logging into a unified platform.

## 🚀 Features

- **Inventory Management**: Track products, stock levels, and pricing.
- **Point of Sale (POS)**: Built-in calculator and sales processing interface.
- **Real-time Chat**: Integrated WebSocket-based chat for team communication.
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive logging system to track user actions and system events.
- **Mobile Ready**: Built with Capacitor for mobile deployment (Android).
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with a focus on user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Angular 17
- **Styling**: CSS / Angular Material (implied)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO Client
- **Mobile**: Capacitor

### Backend

- **Framework**: Next.js 16
- **Server**: Express & Node.js
- **Database/Auth**: Firebase Admin SDK
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO Server

## 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli): `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## ⚙️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd jjm-inventory
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the backend directory and install its dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

To run the full application, you need to start the backend servers (API + WebSocket) and the frontend development server.

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Run all servers simultaneously with a single command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start **all three services**:

- **Frontend** on `http://localhost:4200/` (Angular application)
- **Backend API** on `http://localhost:3000` (Next.js API routes)
- **WebSocket Server** on `http://localhost:3001` (Socket.IO for real-time chat)

All servers will run in parallel with color-coded output for easy identification.

### Manual Start (Alternative)

If you prefer to run the servers separately:

#### 1. Start the Backend Servers

The backend runs both the Next.js API server and the Socket.IO WebSocket server.

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

_This starts two servers:_

- _API server on `http://localhost:3000`_
- _WebSocket server on `http://localhost:3001`_

#### 2. Start the Frontend Application

Open a new terminal window (keep the backend running) and start the Angular application.

```bash
# From the root directory
npm start
```

_The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`._

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`/src`**: Contains the Angular frontend source code (Components, Services, etc.).
- **`/backend`**: Contains the Next.js backend source code (API routes, Socket.IO server).
- **`/android`**: Android project files (generated by Capacitor).

## 📱 Mobile Build (Android)

To build the project for Android:

```bash
npm run apk:release
```

_This command builds the web assets, copies them to the Android project, and assembles the release APK._
